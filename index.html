          <p> IT / Tech Support / Systems Administration / Network & System Security 

Experienced IT/Programmer/Security Engineer with 8+ years in the industry 

working with small to large networks, performing installation, administration, 

maintenance and security solutions.

Eager to learn new software and technologies as they are released.

Happy to help end users find solutions to problems/complications they’re 

having even when it’s non-work related.

Get things done on a set deadline and have no problems working under 

pressure, or multi-tasking.

Able to work with teams and prefer working with small close-knit teams, able 

to work without supervision/instruction.<br>

Very strong communication skills, including communication with non-techs and 

being able to come to an understanding by using analogies or comparisons to 

explain situations to those non-techs (consumers, supervisors, etc.)

Easy going with a strong work ethic, there's a time for everything.
<br>

I am a problem solver, due to the fact I spend most of my time in UNIX I often 

toss an “ls” at a w32 environment.  

Because of this I wrote an ls.bat in my %windir%/system32 that is nothing 

more than @echo off / dir.</p>
